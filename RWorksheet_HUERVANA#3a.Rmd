## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#1 A Produce a vector that contains the first 11 letters.


  LETTERS1to11 <- LETTERS[1:11]
  LETTERS1to11
  
#1 B Produce a vector that contains the odd numbered letters.
  
  odd_letters <- LETTERS1to11[c(TRUE, FALSE)]
  odd_letters

  
#1 C Produce a vector that contains the vowels.

  vowelsLETTERS <- LETTERS1to11[LETTERS1to11 %in% c("A", "E","I", "O", "U")]
