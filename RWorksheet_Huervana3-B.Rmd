#You have a table with 20 rows and 6 columns. The columns are:

#Respondents: A number that identifies each person.
#Sex: Tells if the person is a male (1) or female (2).
#Father's Occupation:  indicates the father's occupation .
#Persons at Home: Indicates how many people are in the person's home.
#Siblings at School: Tells you how many siblings of the person are going to school.
#Type of House: describes the type of house  

#1.C Is the mean number of siblings attending is 5?
sibsMean <- mean(householdData$SiblingsAtSchool)

# the mean of the number of siblings at school is 2.95, which is not 5

#1.D Extract the 1st two rows and then all the columns using the subsetting functions.

#1.E Extract 3rd and 5th row with 2nd and 4th column.

#1.F Select the variable types of houses then store the vector that results as types_houses.

#1.G Select only all Males respondent that their father occupation was farmer.

#1.H Select only all females respondent that have greater than or equal to 5 number of siblings attending school.

#You have an empty data table with no rows and 5 columns. 

#These columns have different data types:
#ints: They can hold whole numbers (integers).
#doubles: They can store decimal numbers.
#characters: These columns can hold text or words.
#logicals: They can store either "true" or "false" values.
#factors: These are used to categorize data but currently have no categories (0 levels), so they're essentially empty.
#This table is like a template and can be filled with data later.

# Based on this data, we can infer that public sentiment is influenced by external events or circumstances, and it fluctuates from day to day in response to these factors.
