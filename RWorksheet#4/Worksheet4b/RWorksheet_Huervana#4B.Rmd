```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


1. Using the for loop, create an R script that will display a 5x5 matrix as shown in Figure 1. 

It must contain vectorA = [1,2,3,4,5] and a 5 x 5 zero matrix.

```{r}

vectorA <- c(1,2,3,4,5)

matrx <- matrix(0,nrow = 5, ncol =5)

for (j in 1:5)
  for (k in 1:5)
  {
    matrx[j,k] <- abs (vectorA[j] - vectorA[k])
  }

matrx


```

2. Print the string "*" using for() function. The output should be the same as shown
in Figure 2

```{r}

for(i in 1:5) {
  stars <- rep("*", i)
  print(stars)
}

```

3. Get an input from the user to print the Fibonacci sequence starting from the 1st input
up to 500. Use repeat and break statements. Write the R Scripts and its output.


```{r}

userInput <- as.integer(readline("Enter starting number for Fibonacci sequence: "))

if(is.na(userInput || userInput < 0)) {
  cat("Please enter something")
} else {
  x <- userInput
  y <- 0
  
  
cat("Fibonacci sequence starting from", userInput, ":\n")

repeat {
  
  next_num <- x + y
  
  if (next_num > 500){
    break
  }
  cat(next_num, " ")
  x <- y
  y <- next_num
  
}
}

```

4. Import the dataset as shown in Figure 1 you have created previously.

A. What is the R script for importing an excel or a csv file? Display the first 6 rows of the dataset? 
Show your codes and its result.

```{r}

importData <- read.csv("HouseholdData.csv")

head(importData)

```

B. Create a subset for gender(female and male). How many observations are there in
Male? How about in Female? 
Write the R scripts and its output.

```{r}

males <- importData[importData$Gender == "M",]
males

females <- importData[importData$Gender == "F",]
females

numofMale <- nrow(males)
numofMale

numofFem <- nrow(females)
numofFem


```

C. Create a graph for the number of males and females for Household Data.

```{r}

MaleFemale <- table(importData$Gender)
barplot(MaleFemale,
        
        main = "Number of Males and Females",
        
        xlab = "Gender",
        
        ylab = "Count",
        
        col = c("red", "green"),
        
        legend.text = rownames(MaleFemale),
        
        beside = TRUE)

```
5. The monthly income of Dela Cruz family was spent on the following:"

Food Electricity Savings Miscellaneous
60        10        5         25
            
A.  Create a piechart that will include labels in percentage.Add some colors and title of
the chart.

```{r}

expenses <- data.frame(
  expenseCat = c("Food", "Electricity", "Savings", "Miscellaneous"),
  cost = c(60, 10, 5, 25)
)

expenses$Percentage <- expenses$cost / sum(expenses$cost) * 100

colors <- c("navy", "blue", "beige", "white")

pie(expenses$cost,
    
    labels = paste(expenses$expenseCat, "(",expenses$Percentage,"%)"),
    col = colors,
    main = "Monthly Expenses of Dela Cruz Family")

legend("topright", expenses$expenseCat, fill = colors)



```
6.Use the iris dataset.
data(iris)

A. Check for the structure of the dataset using the str() function. Describe what you
have seen in the output.

```{r}

data(iris)
str(iris)

#This is a function in R used to load datasets that come pre-installed with R or from packages.
#It provides a concise summary of the structure of the iris dataset. It shows information about the data types of each column, the first few values of each column, and some additional information like the number of observations.

```
B. Create an R object that will contain the mean of the sepal.length,
sepal.width,petal.length,and petal.width.


```{r}

mean <- colMeans(iris[,1:4])

mean

```

C. Create a pie chart for the Species distribution. Add title, legends, and colors.


```{r}

species_dis <- table(iris$Species)
Species <- c("Setosa", "Versicolor", "Virginica")
pie(species_dis,
    labels = Species,
    
    col = c("red", "orange", "pink"),
    
    main = "Species distribution")

legend("topright", legend = levels(iris$Species), fill = c("red", "orange", "pink"),)

```

D. Subset the species into setosa, versicolor, and virginica.


```{r}

setosa <- subset(iris, Species == "setosa")
versicolor <- subset(iris, Species == "versicolor")
virginica <- subset(iris, Species == "virginica")


tail(setosa, 6)
tail(versicolor, 6)
tail(virginica, 6)

```

E. Create a scatterplot of the sepal.length and sepal.width using the different
species(setosa,versicolor,virginica).

```{r}

plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width,
     xlab = "Sepal Length", ylab = "Sepal Width",
     main = "Iris Dataset", sub = "Sepal width and length",
     pch = as.numeric(iris$Species), col = as.numeric(iris$Species))

legend("topright", legend = levels(iris$Species), col = 1:3, pch = 1:3, cex = 0.8, title = "Species")


```

F. 

The scatter plot visually represents the relationship between Sepal Length and Sepal Width for each species in the Iris dataset.
Each point corresponds to an individual observation, and the points are differentiated by species using different colors and plotting characters. 
The legend provides a key to interpret the colors and symbols associated with each species.



7. Import the alexa-file.xlsx. Check on the variations. Notice that there are extra whitespaces among black variants (Black Dot, Black Plus, Black Show, Black Spot). Also on the white variants (White Dot, White Plus, White Show, White Spot).


```{r}

library(readxl)
alexa <- read_excel("alexa_file.xlsx")
alexa

```

A.Rename the white and black variants by using gsub() function.

```{r}

alexa$variation <- gsub("Black  Dot", "BlackDot",alexa$variation)

alexa$variation <- gsub("Black  Plus","BlackPlus", alexa$variation)

alexa$variation <- gsub("Black  Show", "BlackShow", alexa$variation)

alexa$variation <- gsub("Black  Spot", "BlackSpot", alexa$variation)

alexa$variation <- gsub("White  Dot","WhiteDot",alexa$variation)

alexa$variation <- gsub("White  Plus","WhitePlus", alexa$variation)

alexa$variation <- gsub("White  Show","WhiteShow", alexa$variation)

alexa$variation <- gsub("White  Spot","WhiteSpot",alexa$variation)

alexa

```

B. Get the total number of each variations and save it into another object. Save the
object as variations.RData.

```{r}

library(dplyr)

vartotal <- alexa %>% 
  count(alexa$variation)

vartotal
save(vartotal, file = "variations.RData")

```

C.From the variations.RData, create a barplot(). Complete the details of the chart
which include the title, color, labels of each bar.

```{r}

load("variations.RData")

vartotal
varNames <- vartotal$`alexa$variation`

totalPlot <- barplot(vartotal$n,
        names.arg = varNames,
        main = "Total number of each variation",
        xlab = "Name of Variations",
        ylab = "Total of each Variation",
        col = 1:16,
        space = 0.1,
        cex.names = 0.5,
        las = 2)

png("/cloud/project/RWorksheet#4/vartotal.png", width = 800, height = 600, units = "px", pointsize = 12)
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/RWorksheet#4/vartotal.png")

```
D. Create a barplot() for the black and white variations. Plot it in 1 frame, side by
side. Complete the details of the chart.


```{r}

blackVars <- vartotal[vartotal$`alexa$variation` %in% c("Black", "BlackPlus" , "BlackShow" ,"BlackSpot" , "BlackDot"), ]

whiteVars <- vartotal[vartotal$`alexa$variation` %in% c("White", "WhiteDot", "WhitePlus", "WhiteShow", "WhiteSpot"), ]

par(mfrow = c(1,2))
blackVars

blackPlot <- barplot(height = blackVars$n,
        names.arg = blackVars$`alexa$variation`,
        col = c("black"),
        main = "Black Variations",
        xlab = "Variation",
        ylab = "Count",
        border = "black",
        space = 0.5,
        cex.names = 0.4)


whitePlot <- barplot(height = whiteVars$n,
        names.arg = whiteVars$`alexa$variation`,
        col = c("white"),
        main = "White Variations",
        xlab = "Variation",
        ylab = "Count",
        border = "black",
        space = 0.5,
        cex.names = 0.4)

knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/RWorksheet#4/blackNwhiteVars.png")


```
