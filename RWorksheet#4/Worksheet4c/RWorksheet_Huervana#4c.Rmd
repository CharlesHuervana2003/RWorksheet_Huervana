1. Use the dataset mpg

A. Show your solutions on how to import a csv file into the environment 
```{r}

mpg <- read.csv(file = "mpg.csv", header = T, sep = ",")
mpg

```

B. Which variables from mpg dataset are categorical?

```{r}

is_cont <- sapply(mpg, is.character)
catVars <- names(mpg)[is_cont]
catVars

``` 

C. Which are continuous variables? 

```{r}

is_cont <- sapply(mpg, is.numeric)
conVars <- names(mpg)[is_cont]
conVars

```

2. Which manufacturer has the most models in this data set? Which model has the most variations?
Show your answer. 

```{r}

library(dplyr)


MostModels <- summarise(group_by(mpg, manufacturer), numModels = n_distinct(model))
MostModels <- arrange(MostModels, desc(numModels))
MostModels <- head(MostModels, 1)


MostVariations <- summarise(group_by(mpg, model), numVariations = n())
MostVariations <- arrange(MostVariations, desc(numVariations))
MostVariations <- head(MostVariations, 1)


cat("Manufacturer with the most models: ", MostModels$manufacturer, "With ", MostModels$numModels, " models \n")
cat("Model with the most variations: ", MostVariations$model, " with ", MostVariations$numVariations, " variations \n")


```

A.

```{r}

library(dplyr)

UniqueModels <- summarize(group_by(mpg, manufacturer), unique_models = unique(model))

print(UniqueModels)


```

B.

```{r}


# Using plot()
plot(UniqueModels$unique_models,
     names.arg = UniqueModels$manufacturer,
     main = "Number of Unique Models by Manufacturer",
     xlab = "Manufacturer",
     ylab = "Number of Unique Models",
     col = "blue",
     border = "black",
     las = 2,
     ylim = c(0, max(UniqueModels$unique_models) + 1))




# Using ggplot()
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(UniqueModels, aes(x = manufacturer, y = unique_models)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "yellow", color = "black", stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Number of Unique Models by Manufacturer",
       x = "Manufacturer",
       y = "Number of Unique Models") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

2.1

```{r}

# Load necessary library
library(ggplot2)

# Create a smaller bar plot
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = manufacturer, fill = model)) +
  geom_bar(width = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Relationship between Model and Manufacturer",
       x = "Manufacturer",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Model") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 10),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 8))

```

A.

```{r}

ggplot(mpg, aes(model, manufacturer)) + geom_point() 

#The horizontal axis (x-axis) represents the "model" variable, indicating different car models. The vertical axis (y-axis) represents the "manufacturer" variable, indicating various car manufacturers. Each point on the plot signifies a distinct pairing of a car model with its corresponding manufacturer.

#The geom_point() function is employed to place points on the plot, representing each combination of two categorical variablesâ€”specifically, "model" and "manufacturer." This scatter plot effectively illustrates the distribution of car models across different manufacturers. 

```

B.

```{r}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = model, y = manufacturer, color = class)) + geom_point()

#

#To make the plot more informative
#I used different colors or shapes for points to represent additional categorical variables


```

3.

```{r}
