1. Use the dataset mpg

A. Show your solutions on how to import a csv file into the environment 
```{r}

mpg <- read.csv(file = "mpg.csv", header = T, sep = ",")
mpg

```

B. Which variables from mpg dataset are categorical?

```{r}

mpgVar <- names(sapply(mpg, function(x) is.factor(x) || is.character(x)))
mpgVar

``` 

C. Which are continuous variables? 

```{r}

### MALI PA ATA
cont_vars_names <- names(sapply(mpg, is.numeric))
cont_vars_names

```

2. Which manufacturer has the most models in this data set? Which model has the most variations?
Show your answer. 

```{r}


library(dplyr)

manufacturer_most_models <- mpg %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(num_models = n_distinct(model)) %>%
  arrange(desc(num_models)) %>%
  head(1)


model_most_variations <- mpg %>%
  group_by(model) %>%
  summarise(num_variations = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(num_variations)) %>%
  head(1)


cat("Manufacturer with the most models:", manufacturer_most_models$manufacturer, "\n")
cat("Model with the most variations:", model_most_variations$model, "\n")


```

A.

```{r}

library(dplyr)

manufacturers_unique_models <- mpg %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarize(unique_models = n_distinct(model))

print(manufacturers_unique_models)

```
